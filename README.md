# A website for LEGOHOLIC 


## About

 For this project, it is about making a website for a ecommerce platform, LEGOHOLIC, a shop that sells Legos.
 This website will include information about the Lego sets that would be sold, location of LEGOHOLIC, Quizes on LEGO, Images of Lego sets and videos on the Lego company. They can also have some personalisation options and can earn discounts through points. Moreover, it will provide links to external resources, such as the the Lego's social medias and merchandise.


## Design Process

Essentially, the website is for people who are interested in buying Legos to get access to an ecommerce platform that sells Legos. Additionally, there are games and personalisation options for users to enjoy and earn points from. Through the Website more people can get Lego sets easily, as well as learn more about Legos in general through the quizes. This will then attract more users to the site and more profit can be earned.

Users stories:
- As a customer, I want to buy the lego sets, so that I can build Legos
- As a lego fanatic, I want to learn more about Legos and share my interest with other people, so that I can grow my interest in Legos.
- As a regular customer, I would want an easy way to access the legos I'm interested in, so that I can get more Legos.
- As a customer, I would like to keep track of my orders, so I would know the progress of my order.
